/*

    multitasking
    1. multiprocessing: different memory and address, heavyweight process
    2. multithreading: lightweight process share memory with multiple task,
    single memory address, share memory, shared resources

    Thread
    1. extends Thread class
    2. implement Runnable interface
    3. lambda

    Thread LifeCycle / thread state:
    1. New : new object
    2. Runnable : when thread start
    3. Timed_Waiting : sleep or wait
    4. Waiting:
    5. Blocked: with synchronized method or block, with one thread was already there, and second thread was started
    6. Terminated: after thread complete
